# Classification Models in mushroom dataset

I applied decision tree classifier,logistic regression, KNN, Naive bayes, random forest classifier and SVC. For see all results together, i added each model(test result parts) result_all function.I comparised all results at final.
I compared the models according to their performance by using different classification models in the mushroom data set. By comparing the models i use, i can determine the most suitable model for my data set.
